# The Sparks Foundation Tasks

Within this repository, I have compiled the tasks I am currently undertaking as an intern for The Sparks Foundation. My internship focuses on the field of Data Science and Business Analytics, spanning a duration of one month from June 2023. This opportunity allows me to work remotely from home.

## Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML
(Level - Beginner)
- Predict the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours.
- This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
- What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day?


## Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML
(Level - Beginner)
- From the given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.


## Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
(Level - Beginner)
- Perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis'' on dataset 'SampleSuperstore'
- As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
- What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?


## Task 4: Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
(Level - Intermediate)
- Perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis' on dataset 'Global Terrorism'
- As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.
- What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?


## Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports
(Level - Advanced)
- Perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis' on dataset 'Indian Premier League'
- As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.
- Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.


## Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
(Level - Intermediate)
- Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
- The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.


## Task 7: Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis
(Level - Advanced)
- Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of new headlines.
- Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
